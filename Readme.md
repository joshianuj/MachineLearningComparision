# Machine Learning

# Data Cleaning

# Data Analysis

After getting the data, we need to apply FFT and cut it with the frequency ranges **30MHz to 500MHz** so that the data is according to the requirement(as the device which we collect functions at 40Mhz)

# Applying AI

We train the **MLP** with data frame Stopper and Wall using the same distance data.

And for prediction we may use Stopper or Wall files from different distances.

## Requirments

The packages required are

-   pandas
-   glob
-   numpy
-   matplotlib
-   pyQt5
-   sklearn
